# Duke Roguelike

My attempt at making a 7 day roguelike while on a staycation from work. Given I found a library I actually like on the 3rd day of the challenge, uhhh might not be that great tbh.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add some form of combat
- [ ] Add a win condition.
- [ ] Add event bus (shoutout to Erik for this.)
- [ ] Add entity respawner if there's not enough entities around.
- [ ] Add terrain generation
- [ ] Add a more fleshed out AI (At least something like [plug and play state machines](https://roguebasin.com/index.php/Roguelike_Intelligence_-_Intrinsic_Information_and_State_Machine_AIs) and going from there)
- [ ] Add different unit types.
